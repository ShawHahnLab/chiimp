Computational, High-throughput Individual Identification through
Microsatellite Profiling.  For a conceptual overview see the latest

\details{
Starting from file inputs and producing file outputs, the overall workflow
(handled by \link{full_analysis} as a configuration-driven wrapper for
the entire process) is:
\itemize{
\item Load input data.  The input spreadsheets are text files using
comma-separated values (CSV).
\itemize{
\item Load data frame of sample information from a spreadsheet via
\link{load_dataset} or directly from filenames via \link{prepare_dataset}.
\item Load data frame of locus attributes via \link{load_locus_attrs}
\item Optionally, load data frame of names for allele sequences via
\link{load_allele_names}.
\item Optionally, load data frame of known genotypes for named individuals via
\link{load_genotypes}.
}
\item Analyze dataset via \link{analyze_dataset}
\itemize{
\item Load each sequence data file into a character vector with
\link{load_seqs} and process into a dereplicated data frame with
\link{analyze_seqs}.
\item For each sample, filter the sequences from the relevant per-file data
frame to just those matching the expected locus and identify possible
alleles, via \link{analyze_sample}.  (There may be a many-to-one relationship
of samples to files, for example with sequencer multiplexing.)
\item Process each per-sample data frames into a summary list of attributes
giving alleles identified and related information, via
\link{summarize_sample}.
\item Organize \link{analyze_dataset} results into a list of per-file data
frames, a list of per-sample data frames, and a single summary data
frame across all samples.
}
\item Summarize results and add additional comparisons (cross-sample and to
known-individual) via \link{summarize_dataset}.
\itemize{
\item Tabulate sequence counts per sample matching each locus' primer via
\link{tally_cts_per_locus}.
\item Align identified alleles for each locus via \link{align_alleles}.
\item Create a sample-to-sample distance matrix of allele mismatches via
\link{make_dist_mat}.
\item If genotypes for known individuals were provided, create a
sample-to-known-individual distance matrix via \link{make_dist_mat_known}.
\item If identities of samples were provided, score genotyping success via
\link{match_known_genotypes} and \link{categorize_genotype_results}.
}
\item Save analysis results to files.  Spreadsheets are in CSV format for output
as well as input.  Some output files are in FASTA format (alignments and
alleles) or are PNG images (alignment visualization and sequence count
histograms).  If specified in the configuration, \link{saveRDS} is
called on the entire output as well, saving to \link{results.rds} by default.
\item Create an HTML report document summarizing all results.
}

For defaults used in the configuration, see \link{CFG_DEFAULTS}.

The workflow above outlines CHIIMP's behavior when called as a standalone
program, where \link{main} loads a configuration file into global options in R and
calls \link{full_analysis}.  The public functions linked above can also be used
independently; see the documentation and code examples for the individual
functions for more information.

\strong{The Package structure of the source files, grouped by topic:}
\itemize{
\item Main Interface:
\itemize{
\item \code{chiimp.R}: Main entry point for command-line usage (\link{main}) and R usage
(\link{full_analysis}).
}
\item Data Analysis:
\itemize{
\item \code{analyze_dataset.R}: High-level interface to analyze all samples
across a given dataset (\link{analyze_dataset}); used by \link{full_analysis} to
manage the main part of the processing.
\item \code{summarize_dataset.R}: High-level interface to provide inter-sample
and inter-locus analyses (\link{summarize_dataset}); used by \link{full_analysis}
to manage the second stage of the processing.
\item \code{analyze_seqs.R}: Low-level interface to convert raw sequence input
to a data frame of unique sequences (\link{analyze_seqs}); used
by \link{analyze_dataset}.
\item \code{analyze_sample.R}: Low-level interface to extract per-locus
details from a data frame of unique sequences
(\link{analyze_sample}); used by \link{analyze_dataset}.
\item \code{summarize_sample.R}: Low-level interface to condense each sample
data frame into a a concise list of consistent attributes, suitable for
binding together across samples for a dataset (\link{summarize_sample}); used
by \link{analyze_dataset}.
\item \code{categorize.R}: Low-level helper functions used by \link{summarize_dataset}
for samples with known identity.
}
\item Plotting and reporting:
\itemize{
\item \code{report.R}: Various plotting and summarizing functions used when
rendering a report in \link{full_analysis}.
\item \code{histogram.R}: Sequence histogram plotting tools \link{histogram}) as used
during \link{full_analysis}.
\item \code{markdown.R}: Various helper functions for adding tables and plots
to an R Markdown report as used in \link{full_analysis}.
}
\item Utility Functions and Configuration:
\itemize{
\item \code{configuration.R}: Configuration handling helper code and the default
configuration options \link{CFG_DEFAULTS}) used by many chiimp functions.
\item \code{io.R}: various helper input/output functions used loading and
saving sequence data files, spreadsheets, and plots used in multiple
parts of the package.
\item \code{util.R}: Various helper functions used in multiple parts of the
package.
