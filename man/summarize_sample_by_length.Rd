\usage{
summarize_sample_by_length(sample.data, locus.name, fraction.min = 0.15,
  counts.min = 500)
}
\arguments{
\item{sample.data}{data frame of processed data for sample as produced by
\code{\link{analyze_sample}}.}

\item{locus.name}{character name of locus to summarize with.}

\item{fraction.min}{numeric threshold for the minimum proportion of counts a
given entry must have, compared to the total matching all criteria for that
locus, to be considered as a potential allele.}

\item{counts.min}{numeric threshold for the minimum number of counts that
must be present, in total across entries passing all filters, for potential
alleles to be considered.}
}
\value{
list of attributes describing the sample.

\description{
Summarize as in \code{\link{summarize_sample}}, but group entries by sequence
