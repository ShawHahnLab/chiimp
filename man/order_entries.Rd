\title{Define Ordering for STR Data}
\usage{
order_entries(data)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{STR data frame, such as produced by \code{\link{prepare_dataset}}
or \code{summary} from \code{\link{summarize_dataset}}.}
}
\value{
integer vector of new row ordering
}
\description{
Create a standardized ordering vector (as per \code{\link{order}}) for the 
rows of the given data frame, using whichever STR-related metadata columns 
are available.  Sample identifiers are treated as integers primarily but then
resolved further by character sorting.  Note that the identification-related
report code relies on this to order lowest-distance genotype matches first.
