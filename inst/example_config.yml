# This is an example configuration file for a CHIIMP analysis.  These lines
# starting with a "#" are comments.  See the below lines with a keyword
# followed by a colon for example settings.  Sub-sections are indented with two
# spaces.

# "dataset_opts" defines options related to the input data.
#   "dp" defines the directory containing sequence files.
#   "pattern" defines the how the Replicate, Sample, and Locus fields are
#   positioned within the file names.
#   An example file name matching this pattern:
#     "Replicate1-Sample30-A.fastq.gz"
dataset_opts:
  dp: str-dataset
  pattern: Replicate(\d+)-Sample(\d+)-([A-Za-z0-9]+)
# "dataset_analysis" defines options passed to analyze_dataset() by
# full_analysis().  Here we'll just ensure that any example analysis run with
# this configuration is single-threaded.
dataset_analysis:
  ncores: 1
# "output" defines options related to analysis output.
#   "dp" defines the directory that will contain all output files.
output:
  dp: str-results
# This is the location of the spreadsheet defining locus attributes (lengths,
# primers, etc.)  See example_locus_attrs.csv for an example.
fp_locus_attrs: locus_attrs.csv

# There are many more options available than are shown here.  For the full list
# and all default values, see R/chiimp.R.  This file format is YAML
