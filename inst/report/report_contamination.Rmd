## Counts per Locus

These tables show each sample on a row and numbers of reads from each sample 
grouped on columns.  The sequences are categorized by matching locus using the 
forward primer sequence.  The first two columns on the left show the total 
number of reads in the sample and the number of reads matching the expected 
locus, respectively.  Read counts are color-coded on a log scale, binned by
order of magnitude.
