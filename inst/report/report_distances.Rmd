## Inter-Sample Distance Matrix

This matrix shows the number of allele mismatches between every pair of samples,
color-coded to show identical samples as red and maximally-mismatched samples as
white. Entirely missing entries are counted as mismatches.

```{r distances}
plot_dist_mat(results$dist_mat,
              dist_display_thresh = NA)
