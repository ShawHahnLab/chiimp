## Allele Alignments per Locus

These alignment visualizations show the unique identified alleles per locus. 
Allele sequences are grouped and ordered by length as shown on the right. 
Smaller text shown for every sequence shows the number of occurrences identified
in the dataset (with homozygous cases counted twice).

```{r alignments, results='asis'}
