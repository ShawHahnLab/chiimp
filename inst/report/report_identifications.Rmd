## Identification with Known Genotypes

```{r identifications, results="asis"}
rmd_kable_idents(results,
                 allele.names = results$allele.names,
                 hash.len = report.hash_len,
                 na.replicates = report.na.replicates,
                 locus_chunks = report.locus_chunks)
```

### Distance Matrix for Known Genotypes

This matrix shows the number of allele mismatches between every sample and every
known genotype, color-coded to show identical samples as red and
maximally-mismatched samples as white. Entirely missing entries are counted as
mismatches.

```{r identifications_distances}
plot_dist_mat(results$dist_mat_known,
              dist.display_thresh = report.dist_max)
```
